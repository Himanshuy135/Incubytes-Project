# Incubytes-Project
In this project using python we have manipulated the existing database which have only one table of their customers based on different countries. After the execution of .py file,
our database will be added with multiple table named according to the customer's country name. And these tables with different country names will have the data of customers 
belonging only to the corresponding country. Simply, in the end our one table with customers with diiferent country names will be divided into multiple tables which have 
customer data only who belongs to that country only.
